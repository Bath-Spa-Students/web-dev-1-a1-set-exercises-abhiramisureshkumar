            The Avengers (2012)

            The movie "The Avengers" begins with Loki, Thor's adoptive brother, stealing the Tesseract, a powerful energy source, with the help of
             the alien race called the Chitauri. Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. initiates the Avengers Initiative, bringing together a team including Iron Man,
              Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye. They struggle with internal conflicts as Loki manipulates individuals to aid him in 
              his plans for global domination.

            The Avengers track Loki to Germany, engaging in a battle where he escapes. They regroup aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, tensions rising until they
             unite against the threat of Loki and the Chitauri attacking New York City. The climactic battle occurs in New York, with the Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D., and 
             the public fighting against the Chitauri invasion. They successfully close the portal, defeating Loki.
            Loki is captured, and the Avengers part ways, forming a bond and agreeing to remain a team. The film concludes with a mid-credits scene hinting at the 
            introduction of Thanos, setting the stage for future Avengers films and the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe narrative.
